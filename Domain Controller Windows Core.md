The guide provided above is also applicable for Windows Server Core installations, with the focus on using PowerShell commands, which is the primary method for managing Windows Server Core installations due to its minimal GUI. Windows Server Core lacks the traditional full graphical user interface, so management and configuration tasks are typically performed via the command line interface, PowerShell, or remote management tools.

Here's a more detailed guide tailored for Windows Server Core environments, especially focusing on the installation and configuration of a Domain Controller in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS):

### First Domain Deployment on Windows Server Core

#### Step 1: Install Active Directory Domain Services

Open a PowerShell session with administrative privileges. You can do this by typing `powershell` in the command prompt after logging into your Windows Server Core installation.

Install the AD DS role along with the management tools by executing:

```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature -Name AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools
```

#### Step 2: Import the ADDSDeployment PowerShell Module

After installing the AD DS role, you need to import the ADDSDeployment module, which provides the cmdlets necessary for setting up and configuring Active Directory:

```powershell
Import-Module ADDSDeployment
```

#### Step 3: Deploy the New AD DS Forest

To create a new AD DS forest with a specified NetBIOS name, use the `Install-ADDSForest` cmdlet. Here, you'll need to provide the FQDN of your new domain, specify the NetBIOS name, and set a Safe Mode Administrator Password:

```powershell
Install-ADDSForest -DomainName "yourdomain.com" -DomainNetbiosName "YOURNETBIOS" -SafeModeAdministratorPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText "YourSafePassword" -Force) -NoRebootOnCompletion
```

- `DomainName` should be replaced with your desired domain name.
- `DomainNetbiosName` should be replaced with your desired NetBIOS name, which is limited to 15 characters.
- Replace `"YourSafePassword"` with a strong password of your choosing for the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM).

**Note:** The `-NoRebootOnCompletion` parameter is optional and allows you to decide when to reboot the server manually after the installation.

### Second Domain Deployment on Windows Server Core (Additional Domain Controller)

#### Step 1: Install the Additional Domain Controller

For the deployment of an additional domain controller within the existing domain, use the `Install-ADDSDomainController` cmdlet. This will join the server to the domain and replicate the AD DS data:

```powershell
Install-ADDSDomainController `
    -DomainName "yourdomain.com" `
    -SafeModeAdministratorPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText "YourSafePassword" -Force) `
    -NoGlobalCatalog:$false `
    -NoRebootOnCompletion
```

- Replace `"yourdomain.com"` with the name of your existing domain.
- `"YourSafePassword"` should be replaced with a secure password for the DSRM.

This detailed guide is specifically tailored for managing Windows Server Core installations, focusing on command-line and PowerShell operations, which are essential for server administration without a graphical interface.
